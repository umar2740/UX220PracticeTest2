# UX220PracticeTest2
## forms, css, custom elements

The actual test will be 5 questions long. Each question will be worth 2 marks. This practice test is only 3 questions long.

1. Add a contact phone number to the included form. Be sure to use the correct type for your input. 
Make the input match the formatting on the rest of the fields. Make sure that the input type for the 
email is also correct. Use the "required" attribute correctly to make sure that all the inputs on the 
form must be filled in before the form is submitted.

2. Add an attribute to the name and email .form-group divs so that you can add a css rule to give those .form-group(s) a blue background. 
Create blue space equal to the current font size around those .form-group(s). Create more space equal to 1/2 the current font size around 
the .form-group that isn't blue but matches the page background.

The year should update automatically.
